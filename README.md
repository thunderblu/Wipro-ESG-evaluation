# 🌿 ESG-Score vs Financial Impact | Wipro Internship Project

This project was completed during my internship at **Wipro**, as part of the ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) analytics initiative. The goal was to explore the relationship between ESG scores and financial data of various companies to identify actionable insights and cost-optimization strategies.

## 📌 Overview

I designed a project  — from **web scraping ESG and financial data** to **exploratory data analysis**, identifying **key ESG factors** that impact financial investments. The findings were visualized in an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, providing Wipro’s ESG team with cost-saving suggestions and strategic recommendations to enhance sustainability metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for data collection, cleaning, and EDA
